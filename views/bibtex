  abstract = "Abstract Although most land-plants form associations with
              arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) as a means of optimising
              nutrient capture, legacy effects of altered soil moisture regimes
              on plant responses to arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) have not been
              studied. As rainfall patters change with climate change, soil
              moisture legacy effects, and their impact on plants, soil and
              microbes may become increasingly important. Results of an
              experiment are presented in which soil was subjected to a range
              of different soil moisture regimes prior to planting a
              mycorrhiza-defective tomato mutant and its mycorrhizal wild-type
              progenitor. There were clear legacy effects of the soil moisture
              regime prior to planting on soil physicochemical properties,
              plant growth and nutrition, the formation of AM and mycorrhizal
              responsiveness. For example, in the Dry treatment the plants were
              well colonized by AM, there was a clear benefit to the plants in
              terms of mycorrhizal growth responses and mycorrhizal P
              responses. In contrast, in the Intermediate treatment AM
              colonisation was lower, there was little benefit in terms of
              mycorrhizal responses. Finally, in the Wet and Wet/Dry treatments
              AM colonization levels were similar (albeit lower) to those in
              the Dry treatment, but mycorrhizal growth responses were lower
              and more variable. Together, these results clearly indicate that
              soil nutrients, plant growth and nutrition and mycorrhizal
              responsiveness are affected by soil moisture legacy effect.
              Consequently, as we move into a period where more variable and
              intense rainfall amounts and patterns have been projected, we
              need to consider soil moisture legacy effects.",

  abstract = "Products of Axis Communications, mostly premium class cameras and
              wall mounts, have previously been installed on trusses. However,
              Axis has not provided any means of installation so it has been up
              to the installers to create their own solutions. This report
              describes the research and development of Axis first truss mount.
              The aim of the master thesis was to both study the environment of
              the product and the intended user to make it a good fit for both
              the trusses and the users. The goal was to provide Axis with a
              concept solution prototype of both a product and a process of
              installation. To solve this, the authors applied Human-centered
              design in combination with the Double Diamond method. The whole
              method was iterated twice to provide the team with many
              opportunities to receive feedback. The first cycle focused on
              researching and the insights gained laid the foundation for the
              direction of development. Many concepts were developed and the
              cycle ended with choosing one solution and further developing it
              into a testable prototype. The prototype then acted as reference
              for the second round of research. Tests were conducted to see if
              the users used the product the intended way and if the team had
              understood the problem correctly. The final concept has made the
              process of installation easier through the possibility to,
              without tools, swiftly clamp the product in place to make it
              securely fastened for its own weight. This allows for the
              installation to be made in multiple steps that affords pausing in
              between. The concept has received good reviews from both users as
              well as employees at Axis.",

              physical representations of data that are deeply integrated with
              the physical spaces, objects, and entities to which the data
              refers. Technologies like lightweight wireless displays, mixed
              reality hardware, and autonomous vehicles are making it
              increasingly easier to display data in-context. While researchers
              and artists have already begun to create embedded data
              representations, the benefits, trade-offs, and even the language
              necessary to describe and compare these approaches remain
              unexplored. In this paper, we formalize the notion of physical
              data referents - the real-world entities and spaces to which data
              corresponds - and examine the relationship between referents and
              the visual and physical representations of their data. We
              differentiate situated representations, which display data in
              proximity to data referents, and embedded representations, which
              display data so that it spatially coincides with data referents.
              Drawing on examples from visualization, ubiquitous computing, and
              art, we explore the role of spatial indirection, scale, and
              interaction for embedded representations. We also examine the
              tradeoffs between non-situated, situated, and embedded data
              displays, including both visualizations and physicalizations.
              Based on our observations, we identify a variety of design
